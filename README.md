# Minishell

This project is a simple shell program written in C. It should display a prompt when waiting for a new command, have a working history, search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path), handle redirections and pipes.

## Project specifications

For the project we were allowed to use GNU's readline library which handles the terminal interaction (history & input reading).
For everything else the subject allows only to use a few low-level functions and a few POSIX system calls.

<b>Allowed functions:</b>
```readline, rl_clear_history, rl_on_new_line,rl_replace_line, rl_redisplay, add_history, printf, malloc, free, write, access, open, read,close, fork, wait, waitpid, wait3, wait4, signal, sigaction, sigemptyset, sigaddset, kill, exit, getcwd, chdir, stat, lstat, fstat, unlink, execve, dup, dup2, pipe, opendir, readdir, closedir, strerror, perror, isatty, ttyname, ttyslot, ioctl, getenv, tcsetattr, tcgetattr, tgetent, tgetflag, tgetnum, tgetstr, tgoto, tputs```

## How to use

The current version of minishell is developed and tested on macOS.

<b>Requirements:</b>
- GCC / CLANG Compiler
- GNU Make
- GNU Readline library

```
git clone https://github.com/SRein91/Minishell.git minishell
```
```
cd minishell && make
```
```
./minishell
```

## Dependencies
### Install readline with [brew](https://brew.sh/)
```
brew install readline
```

```
brew link --force readline
```

Add the path to the lib

Replace ~/.zshrc with ~/.bashrc if you use bash instead of zsh
```
echo 'export C_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
```
echo 'export LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/readline/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
```
source ~/.zshrc
```

> #### Sample restrictions:
> - All variables have to be declared and aligned at the top of each function
> - Each function can not have more then 25 lines
> - Projects should be created with allowed std functions otherwise it is cheating
